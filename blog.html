                            <p class = "text">So you’ve been wanting to visit for years, and are finally planning your own epic road trip to drive around Costa Rica!

                                For such a small country, Costa Rica is surprisingly mountainous with winding dirt roads and occasional river crossings, so my first time driving there was quite an adventure! Since then, I’ve visited the country many times, always preferring to rent a car.
                                
                                Renting a car and self-driving Costa Rica on your own is the best way to experience this stunning country, as it truly gives you the freedom to stop at every waterfall, volcano, beach, and national park along the way.
                                
                                Here are some important tips I learned about driving Costa Rica, so you’re ready to hit the road and explore the Rich Coast on a vacation you’ll never forget.</p>

                                During the summer, hostels burst with life, the Mediterranean sparkles, streets fill with people slowly drinking wine and enjoy the day, and the late night setting sun leads to long wonderous days. Winter brings Christmas markets, skiing, fewer crowds, and lower prices! And Spring and Fall bring the right mix of people, temperatures, and prices that make these two my favorite seasons to travel Europe.</p>

                            <a href = "#">A Smart Way to Organize Your Travel Photos</a>
                            <p class = "text">As a travel blogger and photographer, I take a lot of photos — and I mean A LOT. Depending on the day, or the trip, I can take anywhere from 50-400 photos…and that’s per day. Consider how many photos I take during an entire trip (eeeep!)

                                While it’s great to capture all those memories, it can be a real challenge to organize and manage them all once I’m back home. And talk about overwhelming.
                                
                                Not only that, but throughout my years of traveling and documenting places, it hasn’t been easy to save and store images (I don’t even want to go into the many hard drives that have failed on me).
                                
                                That leads me to the latest and greatest discovery: Mylio Photos! Mylio Photos is a powerful photo organizing and management tool that’s specifically designed for photographers and travelers like me.</p>

                            <a href = "#">30 Cities In Italy Most Worth Visiting</a>
                            <p class = "text">There are so many cities in Italy worth visiting, yet so many tourists head to the same ones over and over: Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, Naples. These cities are fantastic, but they are far from everything Italy has to offer.

                                I’ve been traveling extensively in Italy for about 20 years, have lived in Italy, visit Italy several times a year, and have explored all 20 regions of the country.
                                
                                Over the years I’ve fallen hard for Bologna, Palermo, Naples, and Parma, just to start! And it seems like a new city every month!
                                
                                What I wish more people knew about Italy was just how diverse its cities can be. Italy wasn’t even unified until 1861 — I promise you, stately Swiss-flavored Torino feels like a different country than wild, volcano-adjacent Catania! Even quiet, mountain-surrounded Trento (I met my husband there!) is a far cry from chic, modern Milan, not too far away.
                                
                                So whichever region of Italy you choose to explore, whether Tuscany or Puglia or Piemonte, I encourage you to get into some cities that you didn’t know much about beforehand. The most famous cities in Italy don’t tell the full story, and in the smaller cities of Italy, there’s quite a bit of adventure waiting for you.</p>

                            <a href = "#">Jet Lag Tips</a>
                            <p class = "text">With long-haul flights a big part of my work, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to overcome jet lag, and beat it at its own game. Some travel writers said that they barely notice changes to their circadian rhythm, and that long-term travel leads to more of the same. But my own body is different. As an insomniac who turned to meditation to help lull my body to sleep, jet lag has been a real thorn.  At the beginning of my travels, I handled the woozy dissonance with mid-afternoon naps and a week of wandering through life as a zombie.

                                It wasn’t enough.
                                
                                I decided to deep dive into research and articles about sleep, jet lag and circadian rhythms. In the process, I came up with a system that has done wonders for me in minimizing jet lag when I shift time zones, and helps me sleep better generally.
                                
                                While this isn’t my typical narrative post, many readers write complaining about jet lag and asking how to make it easier. I thought I would share what I’ve learned. Below, how to beat jet lag while you travel, including some important tips to keep in mind before you even leave home that will help it last a shorter time. And if you’re like me where sleep has long been an issue: keeping some of these tips when you aren’t traveling will likely help you sleep better.</p>

                            <a href = "#">Wat Phu Tok – Visiting The Most Thrilling (and Dangerous?) Temple in Thailand</a>
                            <p class = "text">“The sixth level is the most spectacular… and most scary.”

                                A few people told me as we passed each other, and I started climbing the rickety wooden stairs and ladders up the red rock mountain of Phu Thok (ภูทอก), Thailand’s most adventurous (dangerous?) temple.
                                
                                Welcome to Bueng Kan province, far in the northeastern Isan region of Thailand. It’s one of the lesser visited provinces in Thailand, and you will love it if you enjoy peace, never ending space, nature, and off the beaten path attractions.
                                
                                Without a doubt, Wat Phu Tok (วัดภูทอก) is one of the most unique, thrilling, and scary temples I’ve visited in Thailand, and it’s so incredible. Wat Jetiyakhiri is the official name of the temple, although the more commonly used name is Wat Phu Tok (วัดภูทอก), Phu Tok being the local Isan name for the mountain and Wat meaning temple.

                                What struck me immediately is how it’s in the middle of nowhere, and all of a sudden, there’s an amazing rock mountain formation. It reminded quite a bit of a smaller version of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka.
                                
                                It’s 359 meters high, and the mountain name literally means “lonely mountain,” – you’ll figure out why as soon as you get there!</p>
